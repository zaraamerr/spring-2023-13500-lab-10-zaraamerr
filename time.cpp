/*Hint: You may use minutesUntil to check which time slot is earlier, then find the how long is the interval between their starting
times. They overlap if the movie duration is greater than the interval between the time slotsâ€™ starting times. Alternatively, 
converting times into minutes since midnight can be a good idea as well. (By the way, if you want to be accurate, if one movie starts
at 10:00 and lasts 90 minutes until 11:30, then it does not overlap with a movie that starts exactly at 11:30. However, they would 
overlap if the latter movie started one minute earlier, at 11:29.)*/
