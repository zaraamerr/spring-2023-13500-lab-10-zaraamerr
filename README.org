* specific instructions and requirementsfor lab 10

This and future labs will start with a mostly empty repository. 

You must:

1. Use ~doctest.h~ based tests to test your solutions unless a
   specific task says otherwise.
2. Have a ~Makefile~ with at least the following targets: 
   1. ~main~ to build *main* which will run your project
   2. ~tests~ to build *tests* which will run the doctest based tests
   3. ~clean~ which will remove *.o* files
3. At least three  ~.cpp~ files - ~main.cpp~, ~tests.cpp~ and at least
   one more with solutions to the labs. You will also need the
   appropriate ~.h~ files.


* Notes

Traditionally, you'll create one class specification per ~.h~ file so
for this lab you should have ~time.h~,  ~movie.h~ and ~timeslot.h~. or
something similar. The enum should be declared int the file with Movie
and that ~.h~ should be included in any file that uses either Movie or
the enum. 

* Task Specific instructions
** Tasks A and B 

Write these functions in a ~.cpp~ file, run from ~main~ and test
through ~tests~ via doctests.

There should be no user input. 

** Task C

the *printTimeSlot* function should be renamed *getTimeSlot* and it
should return a std::string. Run from main and test via doctests. 

** Task D and E

Write and test these as per usual - that is, no user input, run from
main, test via  doctest.
